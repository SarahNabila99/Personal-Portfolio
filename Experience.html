After i finished my Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia(SPM) in 2016.  I got hired Bank Simpanan Nasional as a contract worker at their branch in Kota Bharu for a month.  I work as a BR1M distributor along with my work mates.  During the contract, i and my team mates required to distribute the BR1M to the villages who cannot go to the bank during some circumstances.  Although it is tiring, but i got a very valuable experiences in that one month.  Then, after the contract ended, i got to pursue my studies into UiTM Machang to do my diploma.

Then, during the semester break, i worked as a part timer at a convenience store, apparel store to gain my work experiences.  So, during my time, i got a lot  of knowledge and experiences because i meet o lot of people, i know about how to handle a store, and how to treat customers properly.  However, even not much work i do during my semester break, i can know a little  bit of how things work outside of my uni and my personal life.
